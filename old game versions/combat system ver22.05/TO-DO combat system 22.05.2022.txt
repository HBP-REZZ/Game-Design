IMPORTANT TODOs

Dev inventory further - usage since rn its just a basic placeholder, only hp pots have effect

Give player XP etc when battle is won and players are transferred to main world

Send Players to game over screen if dead, with options "exit game, load game, main screen"

Send players to main world with no rewards if successful run away





AESTHETICS and other SECONDARY TODOs

AP stat is unused - should be used for magic spells. This is not important RN since game is meant
to be a DEMO to showcase gameplay. This would take time to implement too. 

Rework Spellbook to be more modular ex. save an array with data inside of each spell in the global
spellbook array so it holds more than just the spell name (rn spell damage is based off weapon damage) 

Lots of animations need to be added (spells, attack, diff sprites, dead, etc) - meh
